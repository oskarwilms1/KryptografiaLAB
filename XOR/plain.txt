rs and god said let there be light and there was light and god 
saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from t
he darkness and god called the light day and the darkness he ca
lled night and the evening and the morning were the first day a
nd god said let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters
 and let it divide the waters from the waters and god made the 
firmament and divided the waters which were under the firmament
 from the waters which were above the firmament and it was so a
nd god called the firmament heaven and the evening and the morn
ing were the second day and god said let the waters under the h
eaven be gathered together unto one place and let the dry land 
appear and it was soand god called the dry land earth and the g
athering together of the waters called he seas and god saw that
 it was good and god said let the earth bring forth grass the h
erb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his k

e earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after his ki
nd and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after h
is kind and god saw that it was goodand the evening and the mor
ning were the third day and god said let there be lights in the
 firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and l
et them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years and
 let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give 
light upon the earth and it was so and god made two great light
s the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rul
e the night he made the stars also and god set them in the firm
ament of the heaven to give light upon the earth and to rule ov
er the day and over the night and to divide the light from the 
darkness and god saw that it was good and the evening and the m

d created great whales and every living creature that moveth wh
ich the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind and ev
ery winged fowl after his kind and god saw that it was goodand 
god blessed them saying be fruitful and multiply and fill the w

arth bring forth the living creature after his kind cattle and 
creeping thing and beast of the earth after his kind and it was
 so and god made the beast of the earth after his kind and catt
le after their kind and every thing that creepeth upon the eart
h after his kind and god saw that it was good and god said let 
us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have d
ominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air a
nd over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creepi

 god said behold i have given you every herb bearing seed which
 is upon the face of all the earth and every tree in the which 
is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be for mea
t and to every beast of the earth and to every fowl of the air 
and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth wherein there i
s life i have given every green herb for meat and it was so and
 god saw every thing that he had made and behold it was very go
od and the evening and the morning were the sixth day thus the 
heavens and the earth were finished and all the host of them an
d on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made and h
e rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made
 and god blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because that
 in it he had rested from all his work which god created and ma
de these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth wh
en they were created in the day that the lord god made the eart
h and the heavens and every plant of the field before it was in
 the earth and every herb of the field before it grew for the l
ord god had not caused it to rain upon the earth and there was 
not a man to till the ground but there went up a mist from the 
earth and watered the whole face of the ground and the lord god
 formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nos
trils the breath of life and man became a living soul and the l
ord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the 
man whom he had formed and out of the ground made the lord god 
to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for f
ood the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tr
ee of knowledge of good and evil and a river went out of eden t
o water the garden and from thence it was parted and became int
o four heads the name of the first is pison that is it which co
mpasseth the whole land of havilah where there is gold and the 
gold of that land is good there is bdellium and the onyx stone 
and the name of the second river is gihon the same is it that c
ompasseth the whole land of ethiopia and the name of the third 
river is hiddekel that is it which goeth toward the east of ass
yria and the fourth river is euphrates and the lord god took th
e man and put him into the garden of eden to dress it and to ke
ep it and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree o
f the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the know
ledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day 
that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die and the lord god
 said it is not good that the man should be alone i will make h
im an help meet for him and out of the ground the lord god form
ed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and broug
ht them unto adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever
 adam called every living creature that was the name thereof an
d adam gave names to all cattle and to the fowl of the air and 
to every beast of the field but for adam there was not found an
 help meet for him and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall
 upon adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed 
up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the lord god had
 taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man an
d adam said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh 
she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man ther
efore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cle
