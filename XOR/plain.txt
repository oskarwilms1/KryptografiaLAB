and god saw every thing that he had made and behold it was very 
good and the evening and the morning were the sixth day thus the
 heavens and the earth were finished and all the host of them an
d on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made and he
 rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made a
nd god blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because that in
 it he had rested from all his work which god created and made t
hese are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when th
ey were created in the day that the lord god made the earth and 
the heavens and every plant of the field before it was in the ea
rth and every herb of the field before it grew for the lord god 
had not caused it to rain upon the earth and there was not a man
 to till the ground but there went up a mist from the earth and 
watered the whole face of the ground and the lord god formed man
 of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the br
eath of life and man became a living soul and the lord god plant
ed a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man whom he ha
d formed and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every t
ree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of 
life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge o
f good and evil and a river went out of eden to water the garden
 and from thence it was parted and became into four heads the na
me of the first is pison that is it which compasseth the whole l
and of havilah where there is gold and the gold of that land is 
good there is bdellium and the onyx stone and the name of the se
cond river is gihon the same is it that compasseth the whole lan
d of ethiopia and the name of the third river is hiddekel that i
s it which goeth toward the east of assyria and the fourth river
 is euphrates and the lord god took the man and put him into the
 garden of eden to dress it and to keep it and the lord god comm
anded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest fre
ely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou s
halt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou 
shalt surely die and the lord god said it is not good that the m
an should be alone i will make him an help meet for him and out 
of the ground the lord god formed every beast of the field and e
very fowl of the air and brought them unto adam to see what he w
ould call them and whatsoever adam called every living creature 
that was the name thereof and adam gave names to all cattle and 
to the fowl of the air and to every beast of the field but for a
dam there was not found an help meet for him and the lord god ca
used a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slept and he took one
 of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib
 which the lord god had taken from man made he a woman and broug
ht her unto the man and adam said this is now bone of my bones a
nd flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was t
aken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and his m
other and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh
 and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not asha

which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman yea hath
